#Courier story:

Russell: He feels like he’s in the line of battle, trying to get from point A to point B yesterday, and he wouldn’t have it any other way. People’s first reaction to his career choice is always, “you must have a death wish.” He’s been doing this for years, he know exactly what he’s doing on that bike. Russell knows that being a good messenger is putting your head down and doing what needs to be done, even when it seems impossible. When he was 12, Russell dreamed of being a professional BMX freestyler, he didn’t want to listen to people telling him couldn’t do something. He’s fulfilling his own happiness and that’s what gives him satisfaction.

#Sender story: 

Patricia: As a stressed-out tech executive who lives and works downtown, Patricia has heard all about how electronic communication has supplanted the demand for courier services, she just doesn’t see it for herself. With her hectic, on-demand lifestyle, couriers are indispensable to Patricia. Whether it’s lunch, laundry, or coffee, the ability to have something delivered quickly and reliably only makes her job easier. And there are still physical goods that need to be transported from business to business within the blocks of Patricia’s city. Nothing can transport them faster than a well-piloted bicycle.
