# Personas/User Stories

Janet is 32. She works as an assistant curator at a historic and highly-regarded art museum. Although her profession and her main love involve the wordless beauty of paint on canvas, she’s also very much a words person. She enjoys writing—she minored in English in college—and her proficiency at crafting coherent and creative sentences serves her well in her position at the museum. An activity which gives Janet personal satisfaction is visiting the home of a friend or acquaintance for the first time and examining their bookshelves. After which, she will invariably grill the person on their favorites.

Glenn is an 18-year-old high school senior. He just took his first programming class and is developing a strong interest in coding, an unsurprising development when you consider his love of video games and science fiction. Deep down, Glenn considers himself a geek and he unabashedly enjoys comics and Dungeons and Dragons. He plans on attending college next year although he’s unsure of a major. He manages to pull down good grades despite working three to four hours a day at the local Starbucks. Typically, he gets home from work at 9pm and studies past midnight.

# Scenarios

Janet is finally getting to take her vacation time and she plans a solo getaway to the islands of Turks and Caicos. With a desire to do nothing but lounge in the sun, sip tropical drinks and read, Janet realizes that she’s been so preoccupied over the past several months with work, she hasn’t kept up with her friends on their reading recommendations. As the sort of reader who’s distrustful of lists in general, whether they be those of an unknown blogger or the New York Times’ bestseller list, she quickly sends several friends texts asking for reading picks. The only friends who get back to her in time either haven’t had the time to read recently either or offer her suggestions that she’s already read. Someone finally recommends trying the internet.

A huge fan of Ender’s Game and its sequel Speaker for the Dead, Glenn was dismayed when he read author Orson Scott Card’s essays decrying homosexuality and same-sex marriage. He was halfway-through Ender in Exile, the 11th novel in Card’s Shadow Saga, when a friend forwarded him Card’s most recent essay about the Supreme Court’s decision on DOMA, and he felt he couldn’t finish the book. Without much free time to truly explore other science fiction authors but desperate to discover new novels and clean out the bitter taste of Card’s theories, Glenn searches the internet for some sort of crowdsourced reference to guide him other than the recommendation engines employed by sites like Netflix and Amazon.
