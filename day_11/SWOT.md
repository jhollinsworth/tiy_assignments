###SWOT ANALYSIS

##Strengths
* **History:** Opened in 1952 by Janie and Matt Martinez—originally on the corner of 1st and San Jacinto, currently South Lamar—Matt’s El Rancho is an Austin institution. It’s history mirrors the history of the city itself. Lyndon Johnson was said to have frequented the original location, always entering through the kitchen door, and the restaurant’s most famous dish, Bob Armstrong Dip, was named after a beloved former Land Commissioner.
* **Locale:** Occupying a sprawling hacienda-style building covered in ivy and surrounded by large oak trees, Matt’s possesses one of the best outdoor dining locations in Austin. A patio which comfortably seats 100-120 people features a fountain and man-made pond stocked with koi carp.
* **Family Friendly:** With it’s spacious outdoor area and unpretentious food, Matt’s has always been a favorite for families. This has forged traditions for many longtime Austin residents. It’s common to hear of memories of graduation parties, rehearsal dinners, or family reunions spent at Matt’s.
* **Menu:** The food, while customary Tex Mex, is consistent and solid. The margaritas are renowned for their potency and The Bob Armstrong Dip has become a national phenomenon, as it’s been picked up (by name) at restaurants in Miami, DC, and most recently, Javelina, currently one of the hottest restaurants in Manhattan’s Gramercy district.

##Weaknesses
* **Familiarity:** It’s that same sense of tradition that can prove to be a weakness for the restaurant. What is seen as revered by some can be perceived as boring and unhip by others. Especially as Austin grows to be a culinary destination, the relatively archaic character of Matt’s can be a shortcoming.
* **Clientele:** Put succinctly, the elderly and children make up a significant portion of Matt’s clientele. This can alienate a large (and growing) segment of potential diners. 
* **Staff:** As a whole, Austin has become somewhat notorious for bad service and Matt’s is no exception.  

##Opportunities
* **New Families:** As the population skews younger in Austin, so does the population of new families. New parents raised on Matt’s, who went through their “not-the-same-old-thing” phase, are realizing the ease and consistency of dining with their children that Matt’s offers.
* **Location:** South Lamar is experiencing the same kind of growth that turned South Congress into one of Austin’s prime destinations. The revitalization of the neighborhood and improvement of its “walkability factor” will only mean good things for Matt’s.
* **Bob Armstrong:** The restaurant immortalized an unlikely celebrity in Bob Armstrong. The timing of his death in March of this year and the opening of Javelina’s in the same month inspired several national articles about his signature dish. 

##Threats
* **Competition:** It’s Austin, Texas. Restaurants, especially those that specialize in Tex Mex, are ubiquitous, and while Matt’s food is praiseworthy, it’s far from the best in town. 
* **Demographic Shift:** It’s still too early to assess the social changes that South Lamar will experience within the next several years but if the neighborhood is truly at the cusp of a new “urbanization”, the perception of Matt’s El Rancho as “staid, boring, and xxxxx” could prove to be damaging.
