Selecting the correct typeface for any project is challenging. Selecting the correct typeface for a project involving a revered Austin institution can be nerve-wracking. Matt’s El Rancho has been an Austin Tex Mex fixture for over 60 years. Obviously they already have a look, a look derived well before the word “branding” had anything to do with activity beyond the cattle ranch. So the challenge is to use a modern, web-applicable font that updates their aesthetic while still maintaining the equity that they’ve built up over their many years as a successful business.

My initial impulse was to match the existing typeface on their neon sign, an iconic South Austin landmark that essentially functions as their logo. It’s a good sign, evocative of the era when the restaurant first opened in the early fifties. The fonts, Brush Script and Helvetica, while appropriate, are rather bland and nondescript in this era of retro-themed typefaces. The two that I’m learning toward for Matt’s website, at least initially, are Kinescope, a nicely updated script with a mid-century flair and Abolition Soft, a condensed sans serif that evokes boxing posters of the past, an appropriate nod to founder and owner Matt Martinez’s Golden Gloves success.
